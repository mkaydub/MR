# MyReads Project

Given the [starter template](https://github.com/mkaydub/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git) for 6th project for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree, the objective is to make the app function.

## To run the app:
* clone [this repo](https://github.com/mkaydub/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git)

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Using the App:
* You can click [here](http://mkaydub-myreads.surge.sh) to use this app!
* Users can search for books and add them to book shelfs: 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', and 'Read'. From the home page, books can be moved to and from Shelfs or removed from shelfs completely.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
